# disease-prediction-using-classifiers
 The purpose of my project is to use a data set about patient information to predict potential diseases in the healthcare industry.
 The research problem is to simplify and shorten the decision making time needed for
patients to know their diagnosis. We can do so by automating it.
This project uses two datasets 
- Patient Information
- Diseases and their underlying symptoms
